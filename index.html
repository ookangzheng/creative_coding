// basic template for creative coding

// this is a function (from canvas.js) that sets you the canvas
// so you don't need to do any of the heavy lifting and can
// start playing straight away
// the function also lets you access the screen width as "width" or "w"
// and the screen height as "height" or "h"

var ctx = createCanvas("canvas1");

// much like processing this is the drawing loop that plays repeatedly
// the actual syntax is a shortcut for requestAnimationFrame

function draw(){

  console.log("mouseX:" + mouseX + " mouseY: " + mouseY);

} // end draw
